			  <h3>Primary School</h3>
			<p>			   
			   I have studied in Xingnan Primary School for 6 years.<br>
			   I joined diablo for a year and quit during primary four. I also joined concert band during primary 6 but i quit after 2 days as i really didnt wanted to go for weekend pratices.<br>
			   At that point of time i still dont take studies seriously and fool around everyday so my results ain't really good. I got 195 for my psle.

			  <h3>Secondary School</h3>
			<p>
			   Then, I studied in Boonlay Secondary School for 4 years<br>		
			   I took Pure Physics and Chemistry, AMaths, Elective geography and the neccesary subjects. I managed to score a aggregate of 9 points raw for olevels.
			</p>			  
			<p>
			   In secondary school I joined Concert Band and was in the Saxaphone section, which i learnt how to play the Alto, Tenor and Baritone saxaphone.<br> 
			   The first four CCA I chose rejected me sadly and I thought why not give band another chance? Which I regreted but atleast, during sec 3 we went for SYF and we have gotten the award of accomplishment. The song we performed was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peXlx-H_pXY"  target="_blank">Phoenix overture and Singapura suite.</a>

			  </figure>
             <p>
			    My hobbies includes badminton,reading light novels, games, and game development.<br>
			    Games include many different genres, i was once addicted to the FPS blackshot, then the Sandbox game Minecraft.<br>
			    Rightnow i mostly play the MOBA game League of Legends and the rhythm game Osu! and fps CS:GO.<br>
				My Favourite series of games would be the Atelier Series, i love how its a rpg game that does not focus on combat but crafting.<br>
				I also read alot of light novels, you can see a list <a href="">here</a> i cannot pick a favourite novel but most of them i reccomend for people to read.
