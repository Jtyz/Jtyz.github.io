			 <h2>Introduction</h2>			 
             <p>
			    From the name of the game, it sounds like an innocent farming game doesnt it?<br>
			    But if you think that, you are 100% completely wrong. The game is way darker than you would expect it to be.<br>
				This game just from the name takes the phrase organic garden to a whole new level. You ARE growing organs which are the <span>fruits</span> and thus it is an organic farm.&#40;dark puns man&#41;<br>

             <h2 id="1g1" >Gameplay</h2>
			   <figure>
			     <img alt="The start of the game where i only have one tree" title="The start of the game" src="images/neworgangarden.png">
			     <figcaption>The start of the game where you only have <br>a single tree and a really slow filling <br>watering can.</figcaption>
			   </figure>
			   <p> 
			       This game combines the aspect of a visual novel and a clicker game and created a clicker game which makes you click so you could learn more about the story.
			   </p>
			   <p>
			       This is unlike other clicker games where there is no purpose like cookie clicker and tap titans.<br>			      
			   </p>	   
			   <h3>Leveling system</h3>
			   <p>
			      At the start of the game, you are only given one tree and a watering can each at level 1 and as expected of level 1 things, the fruits grows slow and watering can fills slowly as well.
			   </p>
			   <p>
  			       As you water and harvest the fruits the watering can and tree will grow in level and the speed of growth,number and quality of fruits and the filling of can will increase.
			   </p>
			   <h3>Quality of fruits</h3>
			   <p>
				  Every chapter, you will get a new tree and at the end of each chapter is determined by harvesting an excellent quality fruit of that tree you have gotten that chapter.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  There are 3 quality of fruits, average, great and excellent. After your fruits ripen, it will be have white sparkles and if you harvest it, it will be an average quality fruit.
			  </p>
              <p>			  
				  If you leave it to absorb more water, it will star having yellow sparkles meaning it could grow up to be a great quality fruit, after the sparkles reach the max size, it is now great quality	.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				  However for excellent fruits, you must leave only a few fruits on the tree and need to make sure only that few fruits are on the tree. After this is accomplished, the fruits will have red sparkles. When the red sparkles are the max size when you harvest, it will be excellent quality.
			  </p>
              <h3>Quest system</h3>		
			  <figure>
			     <img alt="cutscene" title="cutscene" src="images/questsubmit.jpeg">
			     <figcaption>After you complete the quest</figcaption>
			  </figure>			  
			  <p>
			      As the game carries on more quest are given to you requesting certain amounts of a certain quality of fruits starting from 3 to even 100.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				  After you complete a quest you will hear a jingle and you are to submit the quest at the quest tab. After you submit sometimes there might be jingles from the door showing a cutscene.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				  The cutscene will lead to the next part of the side-story or to unlock new things and more quest to do.
              </p>				  
			   <h3>Pets</h3>
			   <p>   
				   There are also pets that you can buy to aid you in taking care of the trees, for example, frogs help to increase the rate of filling of the can, mole to increase speed of growth of the number of fruits.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				   However, the pets has a habit of leaving the tree/watering can and you will need to click them every few seconds to make sure they go back to where you want them to be. Which could be annoying after a while.				   				   
			   </p>
			   <h3>Other equipments</h3>
			   <figure>
			     <img alt="Chapter 3 where i have around 3 trees" title="Around chapter 3" src="images/midorgangarden.png">
			     <figcaption>Around chapter 3 of the game, I have 3 trees<br>Kidney,Heart and Stomach<br>I have the meatgrinder and tranquilade too.</figcaption>
			   </figure>
			   <p>
			      So far, the gameplay does not seem dark at all right? it is pretty simple and relaxing.
			   </p>
			   <p>
			      Here is where the dark part comes, halfway through there is a quest which requires you to make meatballs, and you were introduced to a new equipment; the meat grinder.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			      When you collect an unripen fruit it will be thrown into this machine and made into meatballs which will drop on the floor for you to collect. At this point it just reminds you that you are growing ORGANS. Not normal fruits.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				  Then, there is another quest which requests for pickled organs. Yes you have read correctly, PICKLED ORGANS. You are to place specifically average quality fruits into tranquilade to make them.
			   </p>
			</div>
			<div>
			   <h2 id="2g1">Music, audio, visuals</h2>
			   <h3>Music and audio</h3>
			   <p>
			      The music is kind of cheerful. To be honest I expected a sad, dramatic game, but it’s actually the opposite.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  It’s a strange feeling, hearing happy music during more serious moments. But it’s a feeling I seemed to enjoy nevertheless as it makes me feel relaxed.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  There is no voice acting at all in the game the most is the sounds your pets like the croaks from the frogs or the sounds of the woodpecker flying and the jingles for when you complete a quest or when there is a new one.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  The only issue i have with the audio is that the sound balance is really bad, sometimes the sound of picking a fruit is way too loud or sometimes it will get way too soft and when you get more pets it starts too get really noisy like a zoo.
			   </p>  
			   <h3>Visuals</h3>
			   <p>
			     The game uses alot of fading in and fading out, especially with the pets. The transition of the fadings are really smooth and pleasant to the eye.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				 The game has limited animations and only mostly have static art.
				 The color used are also colorful and beautiful.
			   </p>
			 </div>
			 <div>
			   <h2 id="3g1">&#40;Spoiler warning&#41; Storyplot</h2>
			   <p>
			     From the questlines, there are 1 main story, 7 side-stories and 1 true ending<br>
				 The main story and true ending is truly heartwarming and each of the side stories have a deep meaning in it even though some of them are realy dark.<br>
			   </p> 
			   <p>
			     You play as an apprentice named organa and your master is Irene who was the organ shop owner.<br>
				 the 7 side characthers are, little boy, little girl with her pet cat, woman in black, villager, merchant, doctor, meercat. &#40;I'll one day add this stories here too.&#41;				 
			   </p>
			   <p>
			     At the end of every chapter after you harvested the excellent fruit, your master will be conveniently out for tea with a friend.<br>
				 Then, A mysterious woman in black will show up and force you to pass up the excellent fruit to her without letting you pass it to your master to check first. This happens every chapter untill the last.<br>
				 At the last chapter, your master using the organs made clones of her and her friend going to tea to bait out the woman in black who was about to get the last excellent fruit.
			   </p>
			   <p>
			     It was explained somewhere in one of the side stories that each of this fruit has a soul in it and something bad will happen if a body contains more than one soul.<br>
				 So if you want to transplant a organ into your body, we will need to calm down the soul by pickling it in tranquilade.<br>
				</p> 
				<p>
				 The woman in black has done experiment on herself and her little brother. She is able to make black organ fruits from her body which could melt even stone.
				 She failed the experiment on her little brother and he was about to die. So she came to the organ shop to get all 5 excellent quality of fruits to put it in her brother.<br>
				 However as stated before there should not be more than one soul in a body. So, Irene your master does not want to pass the last excellent fruit to her<br>
				</p>
				<p> 
				  When the woman in black came we learnt that the woman in black and your master studied under the same teacher but believe in different theories and thus they seperated.<br>
				  When the woman in black realize that Irene would not pass over the organ and was about to crush it, she grew one of the black fruits and threw it at your master.<br>
				  At that time you jumped right infront of your master and blocked it for her as she crushed the fruit. The woman in black ran out in despair and your master was trying to keep you alive as you have a gaping hole in your body.
				</p>
				<p>
				  When you woke, you learnt that you have slept for a long time and you asked your master why didnt she replace yourself with one of the organs.<br>
				  &#40;From one of the side-stories earlier we learnt that replacing a living being with a new fruit would cause them to be like an entire different person as the soul within is already different.&#41;<br>
				  Then, your master replied that was because you, organa would not be the same organa as before and she doesnt want that as you were like a family to her. The only person she is close to now.
			   </p>
			   <figure>
			     <img alt="When you completed all the quest, it is counted as a true ending where you unlock this picture and the true ending cutscene." title="True ending" src="images/trueending.png">
			     <figcaption>After completing all the quest in the game<br>D'aww so sweet</figcaption>
			   </figure>
			   <p>
				  Everytime we complete a quest, it fitted into a puzzle in the achievement tab and when we finish all the quest it will finally complete a puzzle of irene sitting with a cat with a hat.<br>
				  In the true ending we learn that Irene has lost her family including a pet cat and all she was left was the knowledge of the fruits.<br>
				  She was crying while apologizing as she place the organ into the 'child'.<br>
				  It was stated that the child originally was a quiet one and is not really active. But now that child is really active and excitable and ask many questions
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  All in all this was a really heartwarming story of a cat apprentice and her master.
			   </p>

			   <h2 id="4g1">Game length,replayability and conclusion</h2>
			   <figure>
			     <img alt="my finished game" title="My finished game" src="images/organgarden.png">
			     <figcaption>FINALLY AFTER 16 HOURS IM DONE CLICKING</figcaption>
			   </figure>
			   <p>
				  The game is around 15 hours to 30 hours depending on how long you take to do things. I finished the game in around 16 hours<br>
				  This game is not really replayable as you would have lost your motivation to continue clicking after you have finish the story.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  In conclusion I rate the game a 8/10 as it has beautiful story, audios and visuals and relatively simple gameplay.<br>
				  It lost marks as expected as it is a clicker game it is wayy too repetitve and there is no way of getting any fruits without clicking unlike other clicker games.
